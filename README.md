Design Patterns with Java

<h2>SOLID Principles</h2>
<ul>
    <li>S => Single-Responsibility Principle</li>
    <p>A class should have one reason to change (a class should have only one job)</p>
    <li>O => Open-Closed Principle</li>
    <p>Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification</p>
    <li>L => Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
    <p>Let q(x) be property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable
    for objects y of type S where S is subtype of T.</p>
    <li>I => Interface Segregation Principle</li>
    <p>A client should never be forced to implement an interface that doesn't use, or clients
    shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they not use</p>
    <li>D => Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
    <p>Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level
    module must not depend on the low-level module, but the sould depend on abstractions.</p>
</ul>
