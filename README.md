Design Patterns with Java

<details><summary>SOLID Principles</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>S => Single-Responsibility Principle:</b></li>
    <p><i>A class should have one reason to change (a class should have only one job)</p>
        <li><b>O => Open-Closed Principle:</i></b></li>
    <p>Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification</p>
    <li><b>L => Liskov Substitution Principle:</b></li>
    <p><i>Let q(x) be property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable
    for objects y of type S where S is subtype of T.</i></p>
    <li><b>I => Interface Segregation Principle:</b></li>
    <p><i>A client should never be forced to implement an interface that doesn't use, or clients
    shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they not use</i></p>
    <li><b>D => Dependency Inversion Principle:</b></li>
    <p><i>Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level
    module must not depend on the low-level module, but the sould depend on abstractions.</i></p>
</ul>
